* Setup Instructions
** Azure Devops Token
The software requires a token, which is store in the file specified by `azdev/token-file-path`. The default value is `"~/.azure-devops-token"`.

You can change this in your config with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq azdev/token-file-path "~/my-token-file")
#+END_SRC

The token file should contain a Microsoft Personal Access Token (PAT) for access to Azure DevOps servers. This PAT is used with Basic Authentication authentication method to access Azure DevOps. Please be aware that the token will be transmitted in header data.

Instructions for getting a PAT can be found [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=vsts&tabs=preview-page#create-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate-access][here]]. It is not necessary to base64-encode this token, as this is handled by the software.

Choose "Custom Defined" as the scope of everything under "Work Items". Keep a copy of the token.
** Emacs Config
Set the teams that you wish to appear in the `team order` vector:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq team-order
      (vector
       "Maxeler"
       "HiRep"
       "Covid-Wales"
       "SOMBRERO"
       "Excalibur Meshing"
       "Cogs" ))
#+END_SRC

You can set translations for the long names, to show
abbreviations, consistent naming or to use initials.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq azdev/user-aliases
        '("Mark Dawson" "Mark"
          "Bob Long-Double-Barrelled-Name" "Bob"))
#+END_SRC

Download the source, for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone github.com/markgdawson/azdev-mode.el ~/azdev
#+END_SRC

And then load from emacs with
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load "~/azdev-mode.el/devops-client.el")
#+END_SRC

A typical emacs config, with no username translation, might look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq team-order
        (vector
         "Maxeler"
         "HiRep"
         "Covid-Wales"
         "SOMBRERO"
         "Excalibur Meshing"
         "Cogs" ))

  (load "~/azdev-mode.el/devops-client.el")
#+END_SRC

** Running
Start the mode with `M-x azdev` or by calling `(azdev)`.

* Mode actions
The following actions operate on the item under point in the azdev buffer. 
** Data Sync
 This will download all current data from Azure Devops.

 Once the data is downloaded, `M-x azdev/draw` will redraw the buffer using current data. Note that azdev makes not support a partial sync/merge/update of remote changes. It fetches all or nothing.

 It does however update the local workitem database when local update functions are called. For example, changing the work item title through `azdev` will both update the remote server, and update the local data store.

** Movement
 Azdev has slightly enhanced movement by work item, bound (in `azdev-mode` to:

 | Key | Action             | Interactive Function (M-x) |
 |-----+--------------------+------------------|
 | C-n | Next work item     | azdev/next-entry |
 | C-p | Previous work item | azdev/prev-entry |
 | M-n | Next team          | azdev/next-team |
 | M-p | Previous work item | azdev/prev-team |

** Changing States
 The keybindings for changing the state of an item are under the
 `C-c e` prefix.

 These are:

 | Key | Action        | Interactive Function (M-x)           |
 |-----+---------------+--------------------------------------|
 | a   | Set as Active | azdev/set-current-item-state--active |
 | n   | Set as New    | azdev/set-current-item-state--new    |
 | c   | Set as Closed | azdev/set-current-item-state--closed |

 For example, `C-c e a` will set the state of an item to active.

 In addition, the `TAB` key will cycle through states.

 These changes are updated immediately on the remote server.

** Changing item title
 `C-c e t` or `M-x set-current-item-title` will change the title of an item, updating immediate in the remote.

** Adding removing items

 | Key   | Action                         | Interactive Function (M-x) |
 |-------+--------------------------------+-------------------|
 | C-c n | Add new item (choosing parent) | azdev/add-item    |
 | C-c d | Delete/remove current item     | azdev/remove-item |

** Misc

 | Key     | Action                        | Interactive Function (M-x)   |
 |---------+-------------------------------+------------------------------|
 | C-c C-v | View in (default) web browser | azdev/visit-current-item-www |
